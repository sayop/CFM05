 Problem1 - b, c
================

Consider the case when :math:`H=W` (a square cavity). Here, the Reynolds number, :math:`Re=UW/\nu`, characterizes the flow patters. Compute the steady state solutions for both :math:`Re=100` and :math:`Re=500`. Plot the flow streamlines and centerline profiles (:math:`u` vs. :math:`y` and :math:`v` vs. :math:`x` through the center of the domain). For :math:`Re=100`, valdiate your method by comparing your results to data from given literature.


---------
 Re = 100
---------

In this test, the lid cavity's velocity is set to make the Reynolds number set to 100. To see the qualitative effect of different grid spacing, four different grid resolution conditions is employed and compared together in this page.

  - **Observation**

    - Denser grid resolution tends to produce better results. The resolved u and v velocities look closer to the reference data.
    - Compared to 10x10 case, the streamline produced with denser grid resolution looks more physically reasonable.

  - **Observation**
   
    - Having resolution of 80x80 makes finally the resolved data looks very close to the reference data.
    - We observed the denser grid size produces the more well-matching data with reference data.

---------
 Re = 500
---------

In this test, the lid cavity velocity is set to 50 m/s to make the Reynolds number 500. Here, only one single set of grid space was employed for effective simulation running, because this high Reynolds number case was stongly senstive to the grid resolution, so it was not successful with less grid points than this to have such that stable solution. Again, due to the computational time issue, having more than the current grid points were not effective either.

The chosen grid resolution is 160x160 in x and y directions. The computation time taken for this setup is 32151.1 sec.
