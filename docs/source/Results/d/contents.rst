Compare your results with different grid resolutions to evaluate the numerical error and the order of the scheme.


The qualitative comparison between different grid spacing for Re=100 case has been made in the previous section. As observed, the less grid point is, the less accurate and the more unstable solution were achieved. Please see section b.

In order to evaluate the numerical accuracy, the numerically resolved LBM data is compared to the reference data in terms of u-velocity component along the centered axial location. Assuming the reference data to be target data that is achieved when the numerical data is accurate, the root mean square (RMS) values were evaluted from the different grid spacing setups.
